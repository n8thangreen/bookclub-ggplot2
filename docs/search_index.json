This website is a companion for the book ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e) by Hadley Wickham. This companion follows the Data Science Learning Community Code of Conduct. "],["book-club-meetings.html", "Book club meetings", " Book club meetings Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book (or part of a chapter). This is the best way to learn the material! Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the ICON local drive.
